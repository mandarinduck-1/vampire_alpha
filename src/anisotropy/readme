//                      VAMPIRE anisotropy module
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module implements various forms of magnetic anisotropy within the
VAMPIRE code, including uniaxial, cubic, surface and temperature dependent
lattice anisotropy. For high performance the Neel anisotropy is rolled into
a tensor for weach atom. The calculation is then a simple vector-matrix-vector
multiplication:

E = ( Sx Sy Sz ) ( Txx Txy Txz ) ( Sx )
                 ( Tyx Tyy Tyz ) ( Sy )
                 ( Tzx Tzy Tzz ) ( Sz )

The tensor form is computed once at the beginning of the simulation and
incorporates the correct components for different materials and symmetries.

Uniaxial anisotropy is implemented with spherical harmonics with even LeGrandre
polynomials. Cubic anisotropy is implemented as directional cosines. Surface
anisotropy expands the local components to an onsite anisotropy which is
time invariant.
